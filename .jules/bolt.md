## 2024-05-23 - Node.js Worker Buffer serialization
**Learning:** Data passed between threads via `worker_threads` `postMessage` undergoes structured cloning. If a `Buffer` is sent, it arrives as a `Uint8Array` in the receiver (not a `Buffer` instance). Calling `Buffer.from(uint8Array)` creates a deep copy (O(n)), whereas `Buffer.from(uint8Array.buffer, ...)` creates a zero-copy view (O(1)).
**Action:** When receiving binary data from workers, always check for `Uint8Array` and create a Buffer view instead of using `Buffer.from()` directly to avoid massive GC pressure and latency on high-throughput streams.
