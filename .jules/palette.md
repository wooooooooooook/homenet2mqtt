## 2024-05-22 - [Accessible Modals Pattern]
**Learning:** Modals using `<dialog>` element often miss the connection between the dialog container and its title/description, making them less accessible to screen readers. Adding `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` props to the reusable `Modal` component allows consumers to easily link these elements.
**Action:** When creating or updating Modal components, always expose props for ARIA labelling and ensure consuming components pass the IDs of their title and description elements. For generic Dialogs, auto-generating a unique ID for the title ensures accessibility by default.
