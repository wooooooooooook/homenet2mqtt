## 2024-05-22 - Consistent Button Component Usage
**Learning:** Inconsistent usage of raw HTML elements vs Design System components degrades UX and Accessibility. Replacing raw `<button>` elements with a robust `Button` component not only unifies visual design but immediately provides critical accessibility features (ARIA labels, busy states) and interaction feedback (loading spinners) that were previously missing.
**Action:** When auditing UI, look for "rogue" raw HTML elements that should be using established system components. The "micro" improvement of swapping these often yields macro benefits in consistency and accessibility.
